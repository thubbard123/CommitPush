It is a simpler version of the Tripane and PDF Advanced template. Although it is a basic template, the content and files have been designed to maximize single-sourcing capabilities. This template starts you out with an HTML5 target and a skin that has responsive output. This means the content display changes automatically depending on the width of the screen. The online output is displayed in a tripane format (navigation pane, toolbar pane, content pane). The template also includes a PDF target, with auto-generation of a TOC, glossary, and index. You can add other kinds of targets if you like." />
